## Some info

This is purely a fun project aimed to be a way to mess around with different leaflet features. Feel free to fork and use as you want.

The Rmd version is not working as of now, I need to fix that. The map2 is a simplified version of map.html that is likely an easier launching point and template for future maps. 

The app.R file makes a somewhat similar map using shiny. Try that out if you want to! I had a lot of trouble installing the shiny package, so give me a shout if you are too and I might know what's up. 

In short, you can ignore all files except the html file you want, the geojson file, and if needed, the folder of image files.
